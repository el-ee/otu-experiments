# create otu table (count reads per sample matching otu x, one line per otu, one column per sample) from the map file (1 line per *read* with all data about it in columns out from there - match, etc.)

python python_scripts/uc2otutab.py readmap_labels.uc > otu_table.txt



# then decided to modify this script to keep the nohit lines under a OTU called 'N' 
# modifications to python script are just these lines wherein previously, anything 
# not matching H was skipped over:
#
# global OTUs, Samples, OTUTable
#	if uc.Type != 'H':
#		# modified to keep no hits, under OTU N
#		OTUId = uc.Type
#	else:
#		OTUId = uc.TargetLabel


python python_scripts/uc2otutab_keepNH.py readmap_labels.uc > otu_table_N.txt

# background from usearch website: what is a no hit? "Some reads may not match any OTU for these reasons: (1) the read is chimeric, (2) the read has more than 3% errors, (3) the read has a singleton sequence so was discarded."
