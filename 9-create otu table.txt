# create otu table (count reads per sample matching otu x, one line per otu, one column per sample) from the map file (1 line per *read* with all data about it in columns out from there - match, etc.)

python python_scripts/uc2otutab.py readmap_labels.uc > otu_table.txt

# then modified script to keep the nohit lines under a OTU called 'N' 

python python_scripts/uc2otutab_keepNH.py readmap_labels.uc > otu_table_N.txt

# what is a no hit? "Some reads may not match any OTU for these reasons: (1) the read is chimeric, (2) the read has more than 3% errors, (3) the read has a singleton sequence so was discarded."
